| **Definition**             | A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements.                       | A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements.                   | A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.         | A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.     |
| **Syntax**                 | Syntax includes square brackets `[ , ]` with ',' separated data.            | Syntax includes curved brackets `( , )` with ',' separated data.           | Syntax includes curly brackets `{ , }` with ',' separated data. | Syntax includes curly brackets `{ , }` with ',' separated key-value data. |
| **Creation**               | A list can be created using the `list()` function or simple assignment to `[]`. | Tuple can be created using the `tuple()` function.                         | A set can be created using the `set()` function.             | A dictionary can be created using the `dict()` function.        |
| **Empty Data Structure**   | An empty list can be created by `l = []`.                                   | An empty tuple can be created by `t = ()`.                                 | An empty set can be created by `s = set()`.                  | An empty dictionary can be created by `{}`.                     |
| **Order**                  | It is an ordered collection of data.                                        | It is also an ordered collection of data.                                  | It is an unordered collection of data.                       | Ordered collection in Python version 3.7+, unordered in Python 3.6. |
| **Duplicate Data**         | Duplicate data entry is allowed in a List.                                  | Duplicate data entry is allowed in a Tuple.                                | All elements are unique in a Set.                            | Keys are unique, but two different keys can have the same value.|
| **Indexing**               | Has integer-based indexing that starts from '0'.                            | Also has integer-based indexing that starts from '0'.                      | Does NOT have an index-based mechanism.                      | Has a key-based indexing, i.e., keys identify the value.        |
| **Addition**               | New items can be added using the `append()` method.                         | Being immutable, new data cannot be added to it.                           | The `add()` method adds an element to a set.                 | `update()` method updates specific key-value pair.              |
| **Deletion**               | `pop()` method allows deleting an element.                                  | Being immutable, no data can be popped/deleted.                            | Elements can be randomly deleted using `pop()`.              | `pop(key)` removes the specified key along with its value.      |
| **Sorting**                | `sort()` method sorts the elements.                                         | Immutable, so sorting method is not applicable.                            | Unordered, so sorting is not advised.                        | Keys are sorted by using the `sorted()` method.                 |
| **Search**                 | `index()` returns the index of the first occurrence.                        | `index()` returns the index of the first occurrence.                       | Unordered, so searching is not applicable.                   | `get(key)` returns the value against the specified key.         |
| **Reversing**              | `reverse()` method reverses the list.                                       | Immutable, so the reverse method is not applicable.                        | Unordered, so reverse is not advised.                        | No integer-based indexing, so no reversal.                      |
| **Count**                  | `count()` method returns occurrence count.                                  | `count()` method returns occurrence count.                                 | `count()` is not defined for sets.                           | `count()` is not defined for dictionaries.                      |
